<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">1. Try Plant Food on all the different plants. Some plants you may have dismissed might have really powerful Plant Food effects.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">2. Don't hoard your Plant Food — using one early on a Sunflower will let you get your defenses up fast.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">3. It's smart to use Plant Food to take out a zombie who is carrying Plant Food. You can do lots of damage and in the end you still have some Plant Food.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">4. Try using Plant Food on catapult plants (Cabbage-pult, Melon-pult, etc.) to deal with Sandstorms and Raiding Parties.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">5. Use Potato Mines on the first one or two zombies in a level so you can focus on getting Sunflowers out quickly.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">6. Collect suns, coins and Plant Food all at once by swiping — it's much faster and easier than tapping a bunch.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">7. Wall-nuts go great with Bonk Choys, Snapdragons and Spikeweeds. Give them a try!</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">8. Don't underestimate the Spring Bean. It's an amazing plant that can turn the tide for you in the Pirate Seas.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">9. Try putting attack plants instead of Sunflowers in the very back. If things go awry, you'd rather have something that can defend itself when a zombie breaks through to the last column. And if the zombies do get that far, Sunflowers are much cheaper to replace than most plants.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">10. Don't give up if you're stuck on a level and out of coins! If you're clever, every level and every star is winnable without spending coins.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">11. Make good use of the zombie preview to make sure you have what you need to go against the kinds of zombies you'll be facing.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">12. Don't be afraid to plant lots of Sunflowers. Two full columns is rarely a bad idea.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">13. Plant Food on Wall-Nut makes him last a very, very long time — great for when you're full on Plant Food and looking to spend one.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">14. Late in the level when your board is mostly full of plants, don't be afraid to shovel up sunflowers and replace them with attack plants. Sun doesn't do you any good if you can't spend it.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">15. Fire your Coconut Cannons often — they recharge faster than you think.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">16. Plant expensive plants like Pea Pod and Coconut Cannon on mine carts to get the most out of them.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">17. Go for the Sun Boost in Ancient Egypt once you get enough keys! An extra 25 sun at the beginning of the level will help you get lots of sunflowers planted quickly.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">18. The Iceberg Lettuce is free! Its ability to help you out of a jam makes it a very worthwhile choice for a seed slot.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">19. In Ancient Egypt, if you use mostly Bloomerangs and Cabbage-pult, you can pretty much ignore gravestones.</font></b></p>
<p class="p1"><b><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" color="#000000" size="3">20. The Almanac suggests that Lightning Reed is great against chickens. It's not kidding — no plant is nearly as good at handling them.</font></b></p></div>
