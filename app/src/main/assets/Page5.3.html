Don’t Neglect The Sunflowers</i></b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><br></b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b>While sunflowers don’t directly help you defend your lawn against the zombies, they’re the plants that ensure you have a lot of sun juice to upgrade your offense and your defense. We suggest having two full vertical rows of sunflowers to ensure that you have enough sun juice at all times. It’s also a good idea to defend your rows of sunflowers by placing a Wall-Nut in front of both of them.</b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><br></b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><i>2.

That’s why it isn’t necessarily a bad thing to fail to complete a level – at least if you paid attention to how the zombies attacked, you’ll know how to get them the next time around.</b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><br></b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><i>3.

There are a couple neat ways to do this, including planting a potato mine in front of one of your Wall-Nuts. You can also plant Spikeweeds in front of your Wall-Nuts, as this would damage any and all zombies that are being blocked by the Wall-Nut.</b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><br></b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><i>5.

If you do this often enough, the zombies will actually “help” you by popping keys that will let you unlock doors, allowing you to gain enough stars to unlock a new world. However, take note that each world has a specific set of keys.</b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><br></b></font></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><i>6.

The zombies won’t eat your Spikeweeds, and if there are some zombies that are able to make it to the end, the Bonk Choy will take good care of them and finish them off.</b></font></div></div>
