He has medium speed and low energy. Beat him with nearly any attack plant. The Conehead Zombie and the Buckethead Zombie have 2x and 3x the energy of the Basic Zombie, so beat them the same way, but with more hits. Block them with the Wall-Nut and Tall-Nut when they come in large numbers. You shouldn’t really need to use any seed packets on them.</b></font></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><br></b></font></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Flag Zombie is exactly the same as the Basic Zombie, except that his coming signals a large zombie army behind him. Now’s the time when you start building up your defenses, putting Iceberg Lettuce and Wall/Tall-nuts in place if you need to, in order to prepare for the rush. The Mummy Zombie, Conehead Mummy, Buckethead Mummy and Flag Mummy are the same as the above four zombies but with different graphics.</b></font></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><br></b></font></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Ra Zombie has low energy, but will steal any sun that drops on the screen until you beat him. Once you beat him, he will drop them all again. Camel Zombies come in groups of three, and each one is very slow and has similar energy to a Conehead. Bloomerangs are excellent for beating them, since they do damage to large groups. Explorer zombies have high defense and will burn your plants, unless you use an ice plant such as Iceberg Lettuce to snuff out the fire. Snapdragons will light their torches back up.</b></font></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><br></p></body>
