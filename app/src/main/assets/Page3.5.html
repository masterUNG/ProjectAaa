This will prevent you from losing the Melon-pults to the Catapult Zombie's basketballs.Conserve your plants, especially Melon-pults and Kernel-pults. Try not to keep all your Melon-pults and Kernel-pults next to each other/put them in a square position; doing this helps keep plants from the camper dropped by the boss. You will risk losing a last line of defense if this happens. Don't panic planting Cabbage-pults next to each other, as they get killed and to appear a little too often.</i></b></font><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"><i>Only when Dr. Zomboss reaches down to attack you with a fireball should you use the Ice-shroom to freeze Dr. Zomboss and put out the fireball, so that your Ice-shroom is not wasted.You should not use a Jalapeno while the Zombot is frozen.

He always places four regular Zombies, four or five Conehead Zombies, then lowers down to breath out a snow/fire ball, then he comes back and places four or five Buckethead Zombies (sometimes he places one Conehead Zombie), then lowers down his head again. After that, the Zombies he places are completely random, except he will not send normal zombies again. After his head lowers the third time, he will then release his Bungee Zombies, then after the fourth, he will drop the RV; after that, his attacks are all completely random. However, they do appear to observe patterns that vary with each fight - some times may include more or less of a particular zombie or attack than usual, or placed in different lanes.The first few plants you get on the conveyor belt are Cabbage-pults, followed by Melon-pults; try to save your Melon-pults for the Conehead Zombies.The first four plants on the conveyor-belt come out in the following order: Cabbage-pult, Jalapeno, Cabbage-pult, Ice-shroom. The order of plants coming in afterward is completely random.If you have only one Roof Cleaner left, he will put almost all of the zombies in the row with the last Roof Cleaner left.</i></b></font><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Arial Narrow&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"><i>If he sends zombies on another lane, use Jalapenos to kill it or else it will make you lose.</i></b></p>
