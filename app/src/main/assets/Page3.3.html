You should try to select as many instant kills, such as the Cherry Bomb, Jalapeno, Cob Cannon, Squash, and Doom-shroom with a Coffee Bean, as you can. The Cob Cannon is also a good plant to have in the your arsenal. You just need to remember that you need Kernel-pults in order to use Cob Cannons.</b></font></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><br></b></font></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b>After two instant kills or 150 normal damage shots, it will hurl an Imp into your defenses, unless it is already halfway into your lawn. Sometimes, a Giga-gargantuar will appear before a normal Gargantuar appears.</b></font></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b><br></b></font></p><p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><font color="#000000" face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Another useful strategy, although unconventional, is to use Puff-shroom, Imitater Puff-shroom and Winter Melons. By placing a Puff-shroom in front of a slowed Giga-gargantuar, and immediately placing an Imitater Puff-shroom once the previous one is destroyed, the Giga-gargantuar will be unable to move at all - or at least move incredibly slowly. This strategy is great because although it does no damage to the Giga-gargantuar by itself, it leaves plenty of time for your other plants to take it down, for zero cost. Thus it is best employed when you have achieved an optimal/self-sustaining team layout where you no longer need to add anything to your team. This also works against regular Gargantuar, though it is not as dangerous as this zombie.</b></font></p>
